### A Custom UI For A Magic Mirror

## About Project

After viewing the button on my family's garageAPI wall for enough years, I decided to finally do something about it. I 
imagined a world where there was a central database for important information about family endeavors, where one could go
for quick information at a glance, but also for more detailed info.

Thus, the Garage-Pi was born.

A Raspberry Pi runs this repo as an Electron app out of our garage. It of course has garage door controls, but it also 
shows tide, weather, and surf data. The app is configured so that new data sources can be easily added at a later date.

## Installation

Clone the repository and run the following command to build and run the app. Good luck!

```bash
npm install && npm start
```
